üìà Time-Series Stock Prediction Simulator (Python)

This Python script simulates a complete machine learning backend process for time-series stock price forecasting. It generates mock historical data, simulates the training of a predictive model, and outputs future price forecasts along with realistic confidence intervals to quantify prediction uncertainty.

‚ú® Key Features

Mock Data Generation: Generates a realistic 90-day history of stock closing prices, simulating a natural market trend with daily volatility.

Simulated ML Prediction: The train_and_predict_stock_price function mimics a forecasting model that projects future prices based on a learned trend and mock random walk.

Prediction Confidence Intervals: A critical feature for financial modeling. Each prediction includes a lower bound and an upper bound, which naturally widen the further into the future the prediction goes, reflecting increased uncertainty.

JSON Output: The final results (historical data, latest price, and all predicted points) are compiled into a structured JSON format, making the data ready for consumption by a frontend application (e.g., for visualization in a charting library).

‚öôÔ∏è How the Prediction Works (Simulated Logic)

The simulation uses a controlled random walk algorithm layered on a slight upward trend. The core logic for the Confidence Intervals is designed to represent real-world model risk:

$$\text{Lower Bound} = \text{Predicted Price} \times (1 - \text{Confidence Multiplier})$$

$$\text{Upper Bound} = \text{Predicted Price} \times (1 + \text{Confidence Multiplier})$$

The Confidence Multiplier dynamically increases with the number of prediction days, accurately modeling the concept that uncertainty grows as you forecast further into the future.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

The script is designed to be run via the command line and outputs the prediction JSON to standard output.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Example Execution

To run the simulation and predict the price movements for a mock ticker (default TSLA) for 14 days, simply execute the file:

python stock_predictor.py


Output Snippet

The output is a structured JSON object, making it easy to parse in any client application:

{
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "latest_price": 163.51,
    "historical_data": [
        /* ... */
    ],
    "predicted_data": [
        {
            "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
            "price": 164.05,
            "lower_bound": 163.23,
            "upper_bound": 164.87
        },
        /* ... subsequent predictions with widening bounds ... */
    ]
}
